# Program Name:  College Team Event Analyzer 


## Description:
This program analyzes the results of various events for college teams over multiple years. It determines:
1. The number of events each team won each year.
2. The total points each team scored each year.
3. The top team each year based on the number of wins, and in case of a tie, the total points.


## Program Structure:
1. analyze_scores.c: Contains the main() function that processes input files and outputs the results.
2. analysis_functions.c: Contains helper functions used in the analysis.
3. analysis_functions.h: Header file with function prototypes and documentation.
4. Makefile: Script for compiling the program.
5. scores19.txt, scores20.txt, scores21.txt, scores22.txt, scores23.txt: Input files containing event data.


## Compilation and Execution:
- Compile the program on terminal using: make
- Run the program after compiling with: ./analyze_scores scores19.txt scores20.txt scores21.txt scores22.txt scores23.txt results.txt

Program output prints on terminal in the format as below:
                     The top team of 2019 was Team 10.
                     The top team of 2020 was Team 10.
                     The top team of 2021 was Team 5.
                     The top team of 2022 was Team 5.
                     The top team of 2023 was Team 6

The results.txt file generates on same directory after program execution. 


## Additional Details: 
                    To write this program, codes references was taken consideration from ideas and hints provided on lab instructions.
